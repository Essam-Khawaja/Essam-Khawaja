## 📂 Data Science Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on — each includes a write-up, code, and visuals:

### 🔹 [Default Loan Prediction](https://hub.labs.coursera.org:443/connect/sharedyldlbirb?forceRefresh=false&path=%2Fnotebooks%2FLoanDefaultPrediction.ipynb&isLabVersioning=file-prep)
**Participated in a coding challenge where I had to predict the probability of a loan payer defaulting**  
- Explored and cleaned the data; used Logistic Regression to predict probability
- Achieved **72% accuracy** on test data.
- Tools: Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, Seaborn

### 🔹 [MNIST Classification](https://github.com/Essam-Khawaja/MNIST_Classification)
**Built a deep neural network to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset**
- Neural network design, training, and evaluation
- Visualization of model performance
- Practical use of deep learning libraries for supervised classification

### 🔹 [Udemy Course Notes and Examples](https://github.com/Essam-Khawaja/Data-Science-Udemy)
**All the notes and code in my learning from the Data Science Bootcamp**
- Explored multiple machine learning models
- Made sure to understand the math and reasoning behind the model, not just the code
